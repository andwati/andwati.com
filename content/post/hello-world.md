How it begins

<!--more-->

In this post-web2.0 age, people seem to blog less and less, and blogs seem to be dying slowly. People are separated in different Apps where the content is not searchable by search engines.

However, I still prefer to write using a blog.

```javascript
function hello(){
  console.log("Hello world')
}

```
