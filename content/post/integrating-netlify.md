Migrating to a better content management system through Netlify CMS

<!--more-->

# Heavy Lifting

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to manually edit the blog post content in this website. This is quite a hassle because I have to deal with
markdown files. There are many problems to this approach and several gotchas. I have to work on a local site repository to be able to edit the content. My github credentials are also required to push my local changes to my remote repository on github so that it can trigger the build process and publish the site.

This process has helped me alot to master markdown sysntax and some practice on my git skills. Itâ€™s fun to update the website content following these steps but sometimes it can be frustrating. At those times, I really miss the user interface of content management systems.
